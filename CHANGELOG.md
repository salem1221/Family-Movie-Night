# Changelog

## v1.4.0 Movie night when somebody is out

- Added a movie night for the evenings when somebody is out. Before the reveal,
  and before a free pick, the phone can say who is missing: only the votes of
  the people present are counted, and a movie carrying a vote of somebody absent
  is no candidate at all. It stays on the list, greyed out, marked "waits for
  Ben", and it cannot be chosen as a free pick either. Taking a vote back is the
  way to release a movie, exactly as it always was, so nothing new had to be
  invented and nobody's favourite gets watched without them. Whoever ticks
  nobody off sees no change anywhere: there is no new setting and no new
  environment variable.
- Recorded who was away on the movie itself, so the archive, the log and the TV
  say "Without Ben" for that evening and nothing at all for a full one.
  Reverting a win clears it.
- Made the television follow a partial night. Who is missing is shared by all
  devices: tap somebody off on the evaluation page of any phone and the board
  recounts everywhere, their films step to the bottom saying "waits for Ben",
  and the crown moves to whoever can actually win. The selection survives a
  reload, reaches the free-pick dialog on a film page, and expires twelve hours
  after the last change so an evening nobody confirmed cannot colour the next
  one. A revert keeps it: that is the same evening, run again.
- Made "We watched it" open the archive, where the film is the top entry and
  its stars are waiting. Rating was two taps away and easy to forget.
- Made every new release open a draft pull request that moves Umbrel to the
  published manifest digest and materializes the matching CasaOS package, so
  the store metadata no longer waits for a manual run. The CasaOS package for
  v1.3.0 is materialized for direct import; Home Assistant stays in its
  templates until the Home Assistant OS device test has passed.

## v1.3.0 App-store runtime and release preparation

- Made the production image adopt a root-owned `/data` mount once and then
  replace itself with the unprivileged `node` process. This enables managed
  app-store storage without changing Unraid's existing explicit `--user` path.
- Added the Home Assistant image labels to both native release architectures and
  CI checks that verify the labels, non-root application process, first-run
  setup, restart, update, port change, backup restore, and both supported data
  ownership paths.
- Prepared non-discoverable Home Assistant and CasaOS package templates plus a
  fail-closed materializer that accepts only a pullable multi-architecture image
  with matching Home Assistant labels. After this release, one reviewed metadata
  update can publish both packages and move Umbrel to the same manifest digest.
- Strengthened package discovery, version-lag, image pinning, architecture,
  privilege, and registry gates. Store metadata may intentionally remain one
  release behind the application, but it cannot point at an unavailable image.
- Gave the strict pull-request publication check an unambiguous status name,
  added CodeQL to the exact-commit release gate, and made each successful image
  publication report its manifest digest in a best-effort summary and JSON
  artifact.

## v1.2.0 Reliable health, a safer default, and the first app store

- Fixed the container health check, which reported every installation as
  unhealthy while the application was serving requests normally. It asked for
  `localhost`, which resolves to `::1` as well as `127.0.0.1` inside the
  container, while the server listens on IPv4 only. `docker ps` showed
  `(unhealthy)` permanently, monitoring alerted on a healthy app, and
  `depends_on: condition: service_healthy` could never be satisfied.
- Changed `ADDRESS_HEADER` to be off by default. It makes the app read the
  client address from a forwarding header, which is right behind a reverse
  proxy and wrong on a directly reachable installation, where the caller writes
  that header and can pick the address the per-IP PIN brake counts against.
  **Whoever runs the app behind a reverse proxy has to uncomment
  `ADDRESS_HEADER` and `XFF_DEPTH` in `docker-compose.yml` after updating**,
  otherwise every visitor counts as the proxy and the brake locks the whole
  household out together. The app now logs at startup which of the two it is
  doing.
- Added an Unraid Community Applications package, so the app can be installed
  from the Unraid app store. It lives in `packaging/` alongside a consistency
  check and an install test that runs the container the way a store does.
- Completed the ARM64 documentation: the ready-made image has been published for
  `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` for a while, but one installation guide still
  claimed otherwise and sent ARM and NAS owners into an unnecessary local build.
- Added a star request to the project website and narrowed the CodeQL scan to
  the source, which had been reporting findings in bundled dependency code.

## v1.1.0 Family setup and public website

- Added a multilingual first-run wizard for new installations. It configures
  family members, one shared family PIN, voting rules, scheduling, viewing
  sources, timezone, TMDB and optional OMDb keys, and movie-language defaults.
- Added settings for the instance name, timezone and automatic session timeout,
  while keeping environment-managed values read-only.
- Added server-enforced session expiry, safer atomic configuration updates and
  a fail-closed setup gate that protects existing data stores.
- Added immediate PIN validation with accessible error focus, responsive setup
  styling and complete setup translations for all supported languages.
- Added the multilingual Popcorn Vote website, live-demo entry points and a
  media kit with reusable project assets.
- Strengthened release, security and browser-test automation, including WebKit,
  coverage reporting, CodeQL and multi-architecture container publishing.
- Existing sessions need to enter the shared family PIN once after updating
  because authenticated cookies now carry a signed issue time.

## v1.0.0 Initial release

- Family movie-night planning with shared votes, movie suggestions, evaluation,
  archive and ratings.
- TMDB and optional OMDb metadata, CSV import/export, nightly backups and a
  Docker-based deployment.
- A PIN-protected, multilingual, installable web app with an optional TV view.
