# Commit id for the version display. Render passes its environment variables as

# these ARGs the build would see neither, and every image would show the same
# bare version number. An ARG is already available to the following RUN as an
# environment variable, so an extra ENV would be decoration. If both values are
# missing, the suffix simply falls away (see vite.config.ts).

# On the final stage, or they would describe the build stage and never reach the
# published image. `image.source` is the one that does more than describe: it is
# what links the package on GHCR to its repository, so the package page carries
# the README instead of standing there bare. No version label, it would have to
# be passed in as a build argument and could then disagree with the tag, and a
# tag that lies about its version is worse than no label.
